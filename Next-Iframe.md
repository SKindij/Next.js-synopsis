# Iframe best practices

_When building webpages, developers often need to include resources from other webpages. 
A popular way to retrieve this type of data is with an iframe. 
Using the `<iframe/>` tag, you can easily embed external content from other sources directly into your webpage._

> ! itâ€™s important to embed content only from trusted sources

Keep in mind also that iframes use up additional memory. 
If the content is too large, it can slow down your webpage load time. 
So you should use iframes carefully.
