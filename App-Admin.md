# Next App Admin
_Authentication is a key part of many web applications today. It's how a system checks if the user is who they say they are._

## [Authentication vs. Authorization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication)

+ **Authentication** is about making sure the user is who they say they are.
  - You're proving your identity with something you have like a username and password.
+ **Authorization** is the next step.
  - Once a user's identity is confirmed, authorization decides what parts of the application they are allowed to use.

> So, authentication checks who you are, and authorization determines what you can do or access in the application.
