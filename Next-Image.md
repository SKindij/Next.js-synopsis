# Next-Image

> Images account for a huge portion of the typical websiteâ€™s page weight and can have a sizable impact on your website's LCP performance.

Next.js `<Image />` extends HTML `<img>` element with features for automatic image optimization:
+ Size Optimization:
  - Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.
+ Visual Stability:
  - Prevent layout shift automatically when images are loading.
+ Faster Page Loads:
  - Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.
+ Asset Flexibility:
  - On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers

```tsx
  import Image from 'next/image'
 
  export default function Page() {
    return (
      <Image src="/profile.png"
        width={500} height={500}
        alt="Picture of the author"
      />
    )
  }
```
